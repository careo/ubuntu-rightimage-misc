Various files and scripts that I want to keep handy for working in Ubuntu RightImages.

This is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. 

I can only make two guarantees about the scripts and files here:

 1. If you use them, and they break something of yours, I'll get real choked up. Honest. There might even be tears.
 2. They probably will end up breaking something.

It also has *absolutely nothing* to do with my employer, RightScale.
